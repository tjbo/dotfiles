This is a repo for my dotfiles. 

To reinstall them:
1 - Install nix
2 - Use standalone package manager and run `home-mananger switch` command

Right now I'm not managing 100% of system software,
there are some exceptions below:

### Software installed manually:
- xcode

### Software installed with Homebrew
- alt tab
- android studio
- google chrome
- whatsapp
- flipper
- 1password (has to be installed in Apps folder to work
properly)

### 3 Hyper Keys
- Hyper Apps - controls switching spaces and apps
- Hyper Raycast - a utility modal, we can do many things with
- Hyper Kitty - a special binding for kitty terminal

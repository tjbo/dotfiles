This is a repo for my dotfiles. 

To reinstall them:

1 - install nix
2 - use standalone package manager and run `home-mananger switch` command


Right now I'm not managing 100% of system software through,
there are some exceptions below:

### Software I downloaded and installed manually:
- 1password
- chrome
- karabiner elements (bind CAPS to ESCAPE and RIGHT COMMAND
to OPTOIN)
- kitty is configured in nix but right now I'm installing it
manually


### Homebrew:
- I installed yabai with homebrew and there is also a path
in my zshrc for it

This is a repo for my dotfiles. 

To reinstall them:
1 - Install nix
2 - Use standalone package manager and run `home-mananger switch` command

Right now I'm not managing 100% of system software,
there are some exceptions below:

### Software I downloaded and installed manually:
- chrome
- xcode

### Software Installed with Homebrew
- yabai and there is also a path in my zshrc for it
- android studio
- flipper
- vagrant
- whatsapp

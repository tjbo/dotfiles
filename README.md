This is a repo for my dotfiles. 

To reinstall them:
1 - Install nix
2 - Use standalone package manager and run `home-mananger switch` command

Right now I'm not managing 100% of system software,
there are some exceptions below:

### Software installed manually:
- xcode

### Software installed with Homebrew
- alt tab
- android studio
- google chrome
- yabai and there is also a path in my zshrc for it
- vagrant
- whatsapp
- flipper
- 1password (has to be installed in Apps folder to work
properly)

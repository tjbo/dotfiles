Why I switched from VSCode to VIM.

By chance I became a very early adopter to VSCode having learned about it when one of the architects at the enterprise company I was working for at the time showed it to me. At that time I was on Sublime Text 2.

But VSCode blew me away, and I immediately adopted it into my workflow.

It was actually the only microsoft product that I have truely ever loved.


# Bloat
It's failure will be it's succeess.

The problem with the lifecycle is eventually it becomes super bloated and dies.

VSCode is getting closer and closer to this cliff.

I find I'm disabling more settings than i'm configuring.

And troubleshooting keybindings has become some complex that they actually have a keybinding debugger built right in.

But I just find it a hassle to get it to work like I want to.

# Seperation of Concerns

VScode seems to be everything built in, but really I like to have things kinda seperated but integrated.

Loosely coupled so to say.

Vim, Zsh and Lazy git allow me to do this much easier.

Minamislism
I can be as minamaslitice as I want with VSCode since I'm really constructing the editor from the ground up.

# I Value Clarity
Vim turns out is not that hard to configure, as long as you know what you are building.

I remember building a VIM config back when I First started to load it and was kind of overwhelmed by it.

Now with more years of experience I am much more likely to spot the things that I absolutely must have as opposed to things that aare just cluttering up the text writing environment.

# I Value Precision


# I Value a Unified experience


# VIM is cool because it's oldskooolz


# At the end of the day we pick our tools more or less based on our values.

And as time chagnes our values can also change.

I'm not going to say that I will committ to using VIM till the end of time (or the AI Apocolypse); howeever its really truly amazing how long this product has been around and maintained massive popularity.

# Notes
## Motions 
Just a list of motions I'd like to use more often
in my daily text navigation workflows.

### `vi{` and `va{`
- these  will select then next function block in visual mode
- very useful for changing everything within a block of code
- vi will select the inside whereas va will also select the
brackets themselves
- once selected we can use o to jump up and down on
selection
- we can use shift v to select full line of all selection
- works with yank, ya{
- works with change, ci{
- and of course delete, da{
- viw also useful
- yiW backwards

###  F, b, r
- F does same things a f only backwards
- b goes backwards by word
- r replaces whatever is under cursor with next keypress 

### screen nav
- <C-D> = down
- <C-U> = up

# ToDos:

- get mini surround 
- do we need friendly snippets?
- think about using telescope-file-browser.nvim
- disabled spectre for now but consider re-adding it
- figure out what to do with diagnostics?
- disable trouble or fix it?
- remap lsp: https://www.lazyvim.org/keymaps#lsp
- consider this: nvim-treesitter-textobjects
- make shell work better, right now seems to have wrong options?
- add shortcut for shell commands
- need a better workflow for creating files on the fly, (and possibly renaming, look for how this is done natively in vim, or find a plugin)
- turn off auto complete when typing in MD

# Notes
- in a plugin if we return a function for keymaps instead of object it will overwrite entire keymaps
